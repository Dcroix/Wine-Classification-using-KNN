The team wishes to learn a model that will classify wines. This project will utilize the K-Nearest Neighbor models with different distance. The KNN models will be assessed in terms accuracy in classifying the wines at the same time speed in processing. 

Using a K-NN model in order to classify the types of wines, it can be observed that using Manhattan Distance provides better accuracy (88.57%) than Euclidean Distance (82.86) with little difference in processing time (approximately 0.002 seconds slower). Given the small difference in processing time and with >5% accuracy, we will be using the K-Nearest Neigbor Model with L1 Distance.
